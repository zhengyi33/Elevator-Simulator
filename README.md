# Elevator-Simulator

I designed and implemented an elevator simulator using design patterns such as singleton, factory, strategy, fa√ßade and data transfer objects;

I also designed and implemented the logic behind the operations of the elevators that makes the elevators work efficiently;

In addition, I modeled the components of the elevator system in a building and the riders that interact with it using 20 classes/interfaces in compliance with the best practices of software engineering;

The simulator is able to compute the statistics surrounding the wait time and ride time experienced by the riders using the simulated elevators;

The entire elevator system is easily configurable using a JSON file with 8 fields. (An example of the JSON file is given.)
